## Step 7: For each language your add-in is available in, create your detailed store listing

Your store listing should include copy, icons, videos, and screenshots. For details, see [our submission checklist](./checklist.md###-✅-Step-7:-Prepare-your-store-listing-with-your-team).

Within the language option, you'll find where you can fill in your add-in's store listing information, such as your add-in description and images.

## Step 8: Decide on your availability date

You can schedule when your add-in will be available. Note it typically takes 4 to 6 weeks to complete an app submission and get it approved. On average, most add-ins require multiple submissions to pass our validation process, so follow our checklist carefully to reduce this time.

## Step 9:  Make sure you add your critical testing instructions

This final critical step requires you include notes for certification, This is any critical instructions for the reviewer who will be testing your add-in, including test accounts, license keys and testing credentials.

If you checked the box stating you require additional purchases, make sure you provide any information such as license keys that a review might need to evaluate your add-in.

>[!TIP]
> Do not include an email address of a company employee who can provide log-in information. Our reviewers will **not be able to email you for log-in information**. Applications that do not list clear instructions in the certification notes will fail the submission process automatically.

The following image shows the Notes for certification box where you must provide information.
